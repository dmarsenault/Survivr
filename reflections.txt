1) How long did you spend working on this project?
About 2 hours.
2) What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding thing with this project was not having any starter code
and trying to create something from scratch.  It feels for the first time like
coming a long way since we are now able to ALMOST create something from scratch.
3) Where do you still have room to grow?
All over!  I still need to learn a lot of the pre-packaged ruby goodies.  What
methods I can call and when I can call them.
